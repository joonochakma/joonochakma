### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Joono
I'm a passionate software developer based in Melbourne, Australia. Currently studying at Swinburne University of Technology, I focus on full-stack development, cloud architecture, and modern web technologies.

I enjoy turning ideas into working code and building practical solutions with clean design and thoughtful architecture. My curiosity and love for technology drive everything I do.

When I'm not coding, I spend my time exploring photography and making music. This GitHub profile showcases the projects I've worked on and the creative solutions I've built throughout my journey.
